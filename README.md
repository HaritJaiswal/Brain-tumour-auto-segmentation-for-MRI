# Brain-tumour-auto-segmentation-for-MRI
 building a 3D U-net to automatically segment tumour regions in brain
 
The MRI scans are preprocessed by generating sub-volumes and standardizing them. Then, a 3D U-net is created which segments the regions in MRI scans of the brain into  4 categories: edema, non-enhancing tumour, enhancing tumour and background.
